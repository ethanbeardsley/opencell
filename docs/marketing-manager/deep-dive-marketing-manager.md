# Introduction

The marketing UI provides marketing teams with the capacity to manage products, bundles and offers from a functional point of view as well as define validation workflow processes and customer care organization.The marketing manager menu is organized into four tabs:

* home page
* offers
* products
* order workflow

# Quick start
The video below gives you a great view on all the sweet goodness of the marketing manager :)

## Home page

After logging in, you are presented with a dashboard including calculation and display of key performance indicators based on Opencell data warehouse information (churn and MRR) as order validation workflow. 

## Offers

All available offers included in the catalog can be displayed. They can be filtered by publication status (active, retired, in design…) and be associated with a given publication period. 
Through this interface, it is possible to create a new offer, export part of the catalog as well as view, edit or create a new version of an existing offers.

The offer catalog provides the possibility to create offers based on any business models. After designing and validating an offer through a pre-defined workflow, the offer can be exported to a new environment such as pre-production or production.

An offer is defined by name, code and description. It is possible, using simple configuration, to add offers to multiple categories, channels or target customer segments.

Physical products, defined in the product section, can easily be bundled into the overall offer:

Depending on your model, you can define a variety of services: 
*Mandatory one-off fee*![figure 12 - mandatory-one-off fee](one-off-fee.png "mandatory-fee")

*Recurring flat fee with partner settlement*

Frequency of the recurring charge is also configurable:

## Products

The catalog lists all available products. They can be filtered by publication status (active, retired, in design…) and have a defined publication period. 
Using the product catalog, it is possible to create a new product or bundle, export part of the catalog, or view, edit or clone existing products.

*Product catalog list view*
![figure 19 - product catalog list view](product-catalog.png "Product catalog list view")

When creating a new product, name, code, and elements of categorization (category, channels, segments) can be set in multiple languages. A publication period (associated with a publication status) as well as a sales price and catalog price can also be defined.

## Order workflow

Customer care users can choose to validate all incoming orders before turning them into subscriptions.A demonstration workflow is provided below to show the possibilities to define rules and assign the orders to some teams based on multi criteria. The default screen shows a “catch all” rule by default:

*Order workflow - catch all rule*
![figure 19 - product catalog list view](order-workflow-catch-all.png "Order workflow catch all rule")Using this screen, it is possible to define a rule. Each rule has a name, associated criteria, and a target team assignation. Workflow criteria can include sales amount (with dynamically defined range), a territory or an account type. The model is extendable. 
Target team assignation is based on user groups as defined in the my company tab.

*Workflow rule configuration*
![figure 22 - workflow rule configuration](workflow-rule-configuration.png "Workflow rule configuration")Once the rule creation is finished, it is displayed in the list. Rule evaluation order can be changed using the arrows.
